# SwiftCharArrayToStringArray
An example function how to convert an Objective-C or C array of strings into a Swift string array

# Why?
I am writing this short tutorial, because as a beginner in Swift I needed a couple of hours to find out how to parse an Objective-C array of strings (char pointers) to a Swift string array. I want to save all the people out there some time :)

# Educational literature
Before you continue, I think you should really know what are char pointers in C, what are array in C, how they are represented in memory and at last, but not least, how Swift deals with pointers. If you already know this - please continue. Otherwise, be sure to read on the Internet about these topics. Here are my top links about these topics:
